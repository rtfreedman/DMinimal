The broom stops hovering when you land.You can send the broom to travel alone to a destination within 1 mile of you if you speak the Command Word, name the location, and are familiar with that place. The broom comes back to you when you speak another Command Word, provided that the broom is still within 1 mile of you."

If losing that much XP would cause you to lose a level, you instead lose an amount that leaves you with just enough XP to keep your level.Gem: Twenty-five pieces of jewelry worth 2,000 gp each or fifty gems worth 1,000 gp each appear at your feet.Idiot: Permanently reduce your Intelligence by 1d4 + 1 (to a minimum score of 1).

Portable property vanishes. Businesses, buildings, and land you own are lost in a way that alters reality the least. Any documentation that proves you should own something lost to this card also disappears.Skull: You summon an avatar of death-a ghostly humanoid Skeleton clad in a tattered black robe and carrying a spectral scythe. It appears in a space of the DM's choice within 10 feet of you and attacks you, warning all others that you must win the battle alone. The avatar fights until you die or it drops to 0 Hit Points, whereupon it disappears. If anyone tries to help you, the helper summons its own avatar of death. A creature slain by an avatar of death can't be restored to life.Star: Increase one of your Ability Scores by 2. The score can exceed 20 but can't exceed 24.Sun: You gain 50,000 XP, and a wondrous item (which the DM determines randomly) appears in your hands.Talons: Every magic item you wear or carry disintegrates. Artifacts in your possession aren't destroyed but do Vanish.Throne: You gain proficiency in the Persuasion skill, and you double your proficiency bonus on checks made with that skill.

However, the keep is currently in the hands of Monsters, which you must clear out before you can claim the keep as. yours.Vizier: At any time you choose within one year of drawing this card, you can ask a question in meditation and mentally receive a truthful answer to that question. Besides information, the answer helps you solve a puzzling problem or other dilemma. In other words, the knowledge comes with Wisdom on how to apply it.The Void: This black card Spells disaster. Your soul is drawn from your body and contained in an object in a place of the DM's choice. One or more powerful beings guard the place. While your soul is trapped in this way, your body is Incapacitated. A wish spell can't restore your soul, but the spell reveals the location of the object that holds it. You draw no more cards."

Each side pouch can hold up to 20 pounds of material, not exceeding a volume of 2 cubic feet. The large central pouch can hold up to 8 cubic feet or 80 pounds of material. The Backpack always weighs 5 pounds regardless of its contents.Placing an object in the haversack follows the normal rules for Interacting with Objects. Retrieving an item from the haversack requires you to use an action. When you reach into the haversack for a specific item, the item is always magically on top.The haversack has a few limitations. If it is overloaded, or if a sharp object pierces it or tears it, the haversack ruptures and is destroyed. If the haversack is destroyed, its contents are lost forever, although an artifact always turn up again somewhere. If the haversack is turned inside out, its contents spill forth, unharmed, and the haversack must be put right before it can be used again. If a breathing creature is placed within the haversack, the creature can survive for up to 10 minutes, after which time it begins to suffocate.Placing the haversack inside an extradimensional space created by a Bag of Holding, Portable Hole, or similar item instantly destroys both item and opens a gate to the Astral Place. The gate originates where the one item was placed inside the other. Any creature within 10 feet of the gate is sucked through it and deposited in a random location on the Astral Plane. The gate then closes. The gate is one-way only and can't be reopened."

The cube rapidly grows into a fortress that remains until you use an action to speak the Command Word that dismisses it, which works only if the fortress is empty.The fortress is a square tower, 20 feet on a side and 30 feet high, with arrow slits on all sides and a battlement atop it. Its interior is divided into two floors, with a Ladder running along one wall to connect them. The Ladder ends at a trapdoor leading to the roof. When activated, the tower has a small door on the side facing you. The door opens only at your Command, which you can speak as a Bonus Action. It is immune to the knock spell and similar magic, such as that of a Chime of Opening.Each creature in the area where the fortress appears must make a DC 15 Dexterity saving throw, taking 10d10 bludgeoning damage on a failed save, or half as much damage on a successful one. In either case, the creature is pushed to an unoccupied space outside but next to the fortress. Objects in the area that aren\u2019t being worn or carried take this damage and are pushed automatically.The tower is made of adamantine, and its magic prevents it from being tipped over. The roof, the door, and the walls each have 100 Hit Points, immunity to damage from nonmagical Weapons excluding siege Weapons, and Resistance to all other damage. Only a wish spell can repair the fortress (this use of the spell counts as replicating a spell of 8th level or lower). Each casting of wish causes the roof, the door, or one wall to regain 50 Hit Points."

      "description": "Wondrous item, very rare  Typically found in 1d4 pots inside a fine wooden box  with a brush (weighing 1 pound in total), these  pigments allow you to create three-dimensional  Objects by painting them in two dimensions. The  paint flows from the brush to form the desired  object as you concentrate on its image.     Each pot of paint is sufficient to cover 1,000  square feet of a surface, which lets you create  inanimate Objects or terrain features\u2014such as a  door, a pit, flowers, trees, cells, rooms, or weapons\u2014 that are up to 10,000 cubic feet. It takes 10 minutes  to cover 100 square feet.    When you complete the painting, the object or  terrain feature depicted becomes a real, nonmagical  object. Thus, painting a door on a wall creates an  actual door that can be opened to whatever is  beyond. Painting a pit on a floor creates a real pit,  and its depth counts against the total area of Objects  you create.    Nothing created by the pigments can have a value  greater than 25 gp. If you paint an object of greater  value (such as a diamond or a pile of gold), the object  looks authentic, but close inspection reveals it is  made from paste, bone, or some other worthless  material.   If you paint a form of energy such as fire or  lightning, the energy appears but dissipates as soon  as you complete the painting, doing no harm to  anything."

In surfaces as hard as granite, a spike at the bottom and three hooks at the top anchor the pole. Horizontal bars 3 inches long fold out from the sides, 1 foot apart, forming a Ladder. The pole can bear up to 4,000 pounds. More weight or lack of solid anchoring causes the rod to revert to its normal form.If you press button 5, the rod transforms into a handheld battering ram and gram its user a +10 bonus to Strength Checks made to break through doors, barricades, and other barriers.If you press button 6, the rod assumes or remains in its normal form and indicates magnetic north. (Nothing happens if this function of the rod is used in a location that has no magnetic north.) The rod also gives you knowledge of your approximate depth beneath the ground or your height above it.Drain Life: When you hit a creature with a melee Attack using the rod, you can force the target to make a DC 17 Constitution saving throw.

On a failure, a target is Frightened of you for 1 minute. A Frightened target can repeat the saving throw at the end of each of its turns, ending the effect on itself on a success.

When found, it contains 1d4 \u2212 1 levels of stored Spells chosen by the GM.Any creature can Cast a Spell of 1st through 3rd level into the stone by touching it as the spell is cast. The spell has no effect, other than to be stored in the stone. If the stone can\u2019t hold the spell, the spell is expended without effect. The level of the slot used to cast the spell determines how much space it uses.While this stone orbits your head, you can cast any spell stored in it. The spell uses the slot level, spell save DC, spell Attack bonus, and Spellcasting ability of the original caster, but is otherwise treated as if you cast the spell.

      "description": "Requires Attunement\tAges past, on the world of Krynn, elves and humans waged a terrible war against evil Dragons. When the world seemed doomed, the wizards of the Towers of High Sorcery came together and worked their greatest magic, forging five Orbs of Dragonkind (or Dragon Orbs) to help them defeat the Dragons. One orb was taken to each of the five towers, and there they were used to speed the war toward a victorious end. The wizards used the orbs to lure Dragons to them, then destroyed the Dragons with powerful magic.As the Towers of High Sorcery fell in later ages, the orbs were destroyed or faded into legend, and only three are thought to survive. Their magic has been warped and twisted over the centuries, so although their primary purpose of calling Dragons still functions, they also allow some measure of control over Dragons.Each orb contains the essence of an evil dragon, a presence that resents any attempt to coax magic from it. Those lacking in force of personality might find themselves enslaved to an orb.An orb is an etched Crystal globe about 10 inches in diameter. When used, it grows to about 20 inches in diameter, and mist swirls inside it.While attuned to an orb, you can use an action to peer into the orb's depths and speak its Command Word. You must then make a DC 15 Charisma check. On a successful check, you control the orb for as long as you remain attuned to it. On a failed check, you become Charmed by the orb for as long as you remain attuned to it.While you are Charmed by the orb, you can't voluntarily end your Attunement to it, and the orb casts Suggestion on you at will (save DC 18), urging you to work toward the evil ends it desires. The dragon essence within the orb might want many things: the annihilation of a particular people, freedom from the orb, to spread suffering in the world, to advance the worship of Takhisis (Tiamat's name on Krynn), or something else the DM decides.Random Properties: An Orb of Dragon kind has the following random properties: \u2022 2 minor beneficial properties\u2022 1 minor detrimental property\u2022 1 major detrimental propertySpells: The orb has 7 Charges and regains 1d4 + 3 expended Charges daily at dawn. If you control the orb, you can use an action and expend 1 or more Charges to cast one of the following Spells (save DC 18) from it: Cure Wounds (5th-level version, 3 charges), Daylight (1 charge), Death Ward (2 charges), or Scrying (3 charges). You can also use an action to cast the Detect Magic spell from the orb without using any Charges.Call Dragons: While you control the orb, you can use an action to cause the artifact to issue a telepathic call that extends in all directions for 40 miles. Evil Dragons in range feel compelled to come to the orb as soon as possible by the most direct route. Dragon deities such as Tiamat are unaffected by this call. Dragons drawn to the orb might be hostile toward you for compelling them against their will. Once you have used this property, it can't be used again for 1 hour.Destroying an Orb: An Orb of Dragonkind appears fragile but is impervious to most damage, including the attacks and breath Weapons of Dragons. A Disintegrate spell or one good hit from a +3 Magic Weapon is sufficient to destroy an orb, however."

If there aren't enough rats to form a swarm, the charge is wasted. Called swarms move toward the music by the shortest available route but aren't under your control otherwise.

A friendly swarm obeys your commands. If you issue no commands to a friendly swarm, it defends itself but otherwise takes no actions. If a friendly swarm starts its turn and can't hear the pipes' music, your control over that swarm ends, and the swarm behaves as it normally would and can't be swayed by the pipes' music for the next 24 hours."

The level of the slot used to cast the spell determines how much space it uses.While wearing this ring, you can cast any spell stored in it. The spell uses the slot level, spell save DC, spell Attack bonus, and Spellcasting ability of the original caster, but is otherwise treated as if you cast the spell. The spell cast from the ring is no longer stored in it, freeing up space."

The target you hit must succeed on a DC 17 Constitution saving throw or become Stunned until the end of your next turn.Lightning Strike.You can use an action to cause a bolt of lightning to leap from the staff's tip in a line that is 5 feet wide and 120 feet long. Each creature in that line must make a DC 17 Dexterity saving throw, taking 9d6 lightning damage on a failed save, or half as much damage on a successful one.Thunderclap: You can use an action to cause the staff to issue a deafening thunderclap, audible out to 600 feet. Each creature within 60 feet of you (not including you) must make a DC 17 Constitution saving throw. On a failed save, a creature takes 2d6 thunder damage and becomes Deafened for 1 minute. On a successful save, a creature takes half damage and isn't Deafened.Thunder and Lightning: You can use an action to use the Lightning Strike and Thunderclap properties at the same time. Doing so doesn't expend the daily use of those properties, only the use of this one."
