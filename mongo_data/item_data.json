Dealing 5 slashing damage to the net (AC 10) also frees the creature without harming it, ending the effect and destroying the net.

However, if doing so brings the staff's total number of Charges above 50, the staff explodes as if you activated its retributive strike (see below).Spells: While holding the staff, you can use an action to expend some of its Charges to cast one of the following Spells from it, using your spell save DC and Spellcasting ability: Conjure Elemental (7 charges), Dispel Magic (3 charges), Fireball (7th-level version, 7 charges), Flaming Sphere (2 charges), Ice Storm (4 charges), Invisibility (2 charges), knock (2 charges), Lightning Bolt (7th-level version, 7 charges), Passwall (5 charges), Plane Shift (7 charges), Telekinesis (5 charges), Wall of Fire (4 charges), or web (2 charges).You can also use an action to cast one of the following Spells from the staff without using any charges: Arcane Lock, Detect Magic, enlarge/reduce, light, Mage Hand, or Protection from Evil and Good.Retributive Strike: You can use an action to break the staff over your knee or against a solid surface, performing a retributive strike. The staff is destroyed and releases its remaining magic in an explosion that expands to fill a 30-foot-radius Sphere centered on it.You have a 50 percent chance to instantly travel to a random plane of existence, avoiding the explosion. If you fail to avoid the effect, you take force damage equal to 16 x the number of Charges in the staff. Every other creature in the area must make a DC 17 Dexterity saving throw. On a failed save, a creature takes an amount of damage based on how far away it is from the point of Origin, as shown in the following table. On a successful save, a creature takes half as much damage.Distance from Origin — Damage:10 ft. away or closer — 8 x the number of Charges in the staff11 to 20 ft. away — 6 x the number of Charges in the staff21 to 30 ft. away — 4 x the number of Charges in the staff",

Most (75 percent) of these decks have only thirteen cards, but the rest have twenty-two.Before you draw a card, you must declare how many cards you intend to draw and then draw them randomly (you can use an altered deck of playing cards to simulate the deck). Any cards drawn in excess of this number have no effect. Otherwise, as soon as you draw a card from the deck, its magic takes effect. You must draw each card no more than 1 hour after the previous draw. If you fail to draw the chosen number, the remaining number of cards fly from the deck on their own and take effect all at once.Once a card is drawn, it fades from existence.

Otherwise, this card has no effect.Donjon: You disappear and become entombed in a state of suspended animation in an extradimensional Sphere. Everything you were wearing and carrying stays behind in the space you occupied when you disappeared. You remain imprisoned until you are found and removed from the Sphere. You can't be located by any Divination magic, but a wish spell can reveal the location of your prison. You draw no more cards.Euryale: The card's medusa-like visage curses you. You take a -2 penalty on Saving Throws while cursed in this way. Only a god or the magic of The Fates card can end this curse.The Fates: Reality's fabric unravels and spins anew, allowing you to avoid or erase one event as if it never happened. You can use the card's magic as soon as you draw the card or at any other time before you die.Flames: A powerful devil becomes your enemy.

This enmity lasts until either you or the devil dies.Fool: You lose 10,000 XP, discard this card, and draw from the deck again, counting both draws as one of your declared draws.

You control this character.Moon: You are granted the ability to cast the wish spell 1d3 times.Rogue: A nonplayer character of the DM's choice becomes hostile toward you. The identity of your new enemy isn't known until the NPC or someone else reveals it. Nothing less than a wish spell or Divine Intervention can end the NPC's hostility toward you.Ruin: All forms of Wealth that you carry or own, other than Magic Items, are lost to you. Portable property vanishes. Businesses, buildings, and land you own are lost in a way that alters reality the least. Any documentation that proves you should own something lost to this card also disappears.Skull: You summon an avatar of death-a ghostly humanoid Skeleton clad in a tattered black robe and carrying a spectral scythe. It appears in a space of the DM's choice within 10 feet of you and attacks you, warning all others that you must win the battle alone. The avatar fights until you die or it drops to 0 Hit Points, whereupon it disappears. If anyone tries to help you, the helper summons its own avatar of death. A creature slain by an avatar of death can't be restored to life.Star: Increase one of your Ability Scores by 2. The score can exceed 20 but can't exceed 24.Sun: You gain 50,000 XP, and a wondrous item (which the DM determines randomly) appears in your hands.Talons: Every magic item you wear or carry disintegrates. Artifacts in your possession aren't destroyed but do Vanish.Throne: You gain proficiency in the Persuasion skill, and you double your proficiency bonus on checks made with that skill. In addition, you gain rightful ownership of a small keep somewhere in the world. However, the keep is currently in the hands of Monsters, which you must clear out before you can claim the keep as. yours.Vizier: At any time you choose within one year of drawing this card, you can ask a question in meditation and mentally receive a truthful answer to that question. Besides information, the answer helps you solve a puzzling problem or other dilemma. In other words, the knowledge comes with Wisdom on how to apply it.The Void: This black card Spells disaster. Your soul is drawn from your body and contained in an object in a place of the DM's choice. One or more powerful beings guard the place. While your soul is trapped in this way, your body is Incapacitated. A wish spell can't restore your soul, but the spell reveals the location of the object that holds it. You draw no more cards.",

If the target is native to a plane of existence other than the one you're on, the target must succeed on a DC 17 Wisdom saving throw or be trapped in the flask. If the target has been trapped by the flask before, it has advantage on the saving throw. Once trapped, a creature remains in the flask until released. The flask can hold only one creature at a time. A creature trapped in the flask doesn't need to breathe, eat, or drink and doesn't age.You can use an action to remove the flask's stopper and release the creature the flask contains. The creature is friendly to you and your companions for 1 hour and obeys your commands for that Duration. If you give no commands or give it a Command that is likely to result in its death, it defends itself but otherwise takes no actions. At the end of the Duration, the creature acts in accordance with its normal disposition and Alignment.An Identify spell reveals that a creature is inside the flask, but the only way to determine the type of creature is to open the flask.

      "description": "Wondrous item, very rare  Typically found in 1d4 pots inside a fine wooden box  with a brush (weighing 1 pound in total), these  pigments allow you to create three-dimensional  Objects by painting them in two dimensions. The  paint flows from the brush to form the desired  object as you concentrate on its image.     Each pot of paint is sufficient to cover 1,000  square feet of a surface, which lets you create  inanimate Objects or terrain features—such as a  door, a pit, flowers, trees, cells, rooms, or weapons— that are up to 10,000 cubic feet. It takes 10 minutes  to cover 100 square feet.    When you complete the painting, the object or  terrain feature depicted becomes a real, nonmagical  object. Thus, painting a door on a wall creates an  actual door that can be opened to whatever is  beyond. Painting a pit on a floor creates a real pit,  and its depth counts against the total area of Objects  you create.    Nothing created by the pigments can have a value  greater than 25 gp. If you paint an object of greater  value (such as a diamond or a pile of gold), the object  looks authentic, but close inspection reveals it is  made from paste, bone, or some other worthless  material.   If you paint a form of energy such as fire or  lightning, the energy appears but dissipates as soon  as you complete the painting, doing no harm to  anything.",

It remains activated until you use an action to speak the Command Word again.Any creature other than you that sees its reflection in the activated mirror while within 30 feet of it must succeed on a DC 15 Charisma saving throw or be trapped, along with anything it is wearing or carrying, in one of the mirror's twelve extradimensional cells.

      "description": "Requires Attunement\tAges past, on the world of Krynn, elves and humans waged a terrible war against evil Dragons. When the world seemed doomed, the wizards of the Towers of High Sorcery came together and worked their greatest magic, forging five Orbs of Dragonkind (or Dragon Orbs) to help them defeat the Dragons. One orb was taken to each of the five towers, and there they were used to speed the war toward a victorious end. The wizards used the orbs to lure Dragons to them, then destroyed the Dragons with powerful magic.As the Towers of High Sorcery fell in later ages, the orbs were destroyed or faded into legend, and only three are thought to survive. Their magic has been warped and twisted over the centuries, so although their primary purpose of calling Dragons still functions, they also allow some measure of control over Dragons.Each orb contains the essence of an evil dragon, a presence that resents any attempt to coax magic from it. Those lacking in force of personality might find themselves enslaved to an orb.An orb is an etched Crystal globe about 10 inches in diameter. When used, it grows to about 20 inches in diameter, and mist swirls inside it.While attuned to an orb, you can use an action to peer into the orb's depths and speak its Command Word. You must then make a DC 15 Charisma check. On a successful check, you control the orb for as long as you remain attuned to it. On a failed check, you become Charmed by the orb for as long as you remain attuned to it.While you are Charmed by the orb, you can't voluntarily end your Attunement to it, and the orb casts Suggestion on you at will (save DC 18), urging you to work toward the evil ends it desires. The dragon essence within the orb might want many things: the annihilation of a particular people, freedom from the orb, to spread suffering in the world, to advance the worship of Takhisis (Tiamat's name on Krynn), or something else the DM decides.Random Properties: An Orb of Dragon kind has the following random properties: • 2 minor beneficial properties• 1 minor detrimental property• 1 major detrimental propertySpells: The orb has 7 Charges and regains 1d4 + 3 expended Charges daily at dawn. If you control the orb, you can use an action and expend 1 or more Charges to cast one of the following Spells (save DC 18) from it: Cure Wounds (5th-level version, 3 charges), Daylight (1 charge), Death Ward (2 charges), or Scrying (3 charges). You can also use an action to cast the Detect Magic spell from the orb without using any Charges.Call Dragons: While you control the orb, you can use an action to cause the artifact to issue a telepathic call that extends in all directions for 40 miles. Evil Dragons in range feel compelled to come to the orb as soon as possible by the most direct route. Dragon deities such as Tiamat are unaffected by this call. Dragons drawn to the orb might be hostile toward you for compelling them against their will. Once you have used this property, it can't be used again for 1 hour.Destroying an Orb: An Orb of Dragonkind appears fragile but is impervious to most damage, including the attacks and breath Weapons of Dragons. A Disintegrate spell or one good hit from a +3 Magic Weapon is sufficient to destroy an orb, however.",
